        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Stop wasting your money on low quality ammo and start utilizing your firearm to its full potential and capability!</p>
        <p>Those of us who enjoy shooting know there are three main components that contribute to accuracy and consistency: the gun, the ammo, and the shooter.  At Cutting Edge Ammo we don't believe your ammo should be the weak point in that chain.  We provide you with sub-MOA ammunition (meaning capable of grouping in under an inch at 100 yards) that above all, provides you with the consistency you need to ensure your shot placement is where you need it.  Whether you're looking for the edge in your next Black Rifle or Multi-Gun match, out target shooting with friends, hunting, or searching for a reliable self defense round; Cutting Edge Ammo ensures that what you put through your firearm is up to the task.</p>
        <p>Have you ever felt that your groups are not as tight as they should be?  Assuming you're using a quality firearm, your ammunition is likely at the root of the problem.  Low quality ammo is everywhere.  And it's cheap.  This is because the focus is on churning out as many rounds as possible per hour.  Unfortunately this means cartridges are produced in a manner that results in substantial variation between rounds.  In turn, this means that the first round you put through your firearm will perform differently than the next, and so on.  This lack of consistency makes any real degree of accuracy impossible.</p>
        <p>Your answer is to find a manufacturer whose focus isn't on quantity, but quality.  Cutting Edge Ammo meets this demand.  All cartridges use new brass (annealed in the case of our .223).  All rounds are manufactured using precise and well maintained equipment and to exacting specifications.  We have no quotas to meet.  We have no deadlines to make.  And because we are not beholden to stockholders or corporate interests, we are free to put our attention where it belongs: on our product.  All of our time and energy is vested into diligently manufacturing the most consistent and accurate match grade ammunition you can get your hands on.  All of this at a price point that enthusiasts can afford to plink at.  Enjoy!</p>
        <p>PS  If you love our ammo as much as we do, please share with your friends.  We love hearing new clientele tell us they fired some of our ammo and couldn't help but purchase some for themselves!</p>
